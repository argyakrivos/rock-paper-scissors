# Rock-paper-scissors

- A Scala implementation of the infamous [Rock-paper-scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors) game.

- It is abstract enough to easily extend it to a [Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock) or any other hand game variation.
